- Follow Conventional Commits convention
- Keep the message short and concise
- Try to refer to features instead of specific file names
- If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, summarize with a very short title, but also add a bullet list below for the different changes.
- Use changes in CHANGELOG.md to figure out the commit message.
- DO NOT include CHANGELOG.md in the commit message, unless it is the only file changed.
