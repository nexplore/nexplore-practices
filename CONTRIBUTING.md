# Contributing

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our projects — thank you for taking the time to check out our work!

## Current Contribution Policy

At the moment, we are not actively reviewing or merging pull requests from outside contributors. Our repositories are published primarily to share our work openly with the community and to provide transparency into how we build our software.

You are very welcome to **fork the repository**, explore the code, and adapt it for your own needs. We hope it can serve as a useful reference or foundation for your own projects.

## Issues

If you discover a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, feel free to **open an issue** on GitHub. While we may not be able to respond to every report immediately, we do review incoming issues and take them into account for future development.
